       "1. **Subtlety and Deception:** Cheaters often use subtle methods to avoid detection. They might be careful about their language and actions, making it harder to spot their behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Avoidance of Direct Answers:** They may try to avoid direct answers when questioned about certain topics. Instead, they might deflect, change the subject, or provide vague responses.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Inconsistency in Stories:** Cheaters often have trouble keeping their stories consistent. They might provide different accounts at different times, or their story might seem implausible.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Defensiveness and Anger:** When confronted, cheaters may become defensive or angry, which can be a red flag indicating their guilt.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Evasiveness and Excuses:** They might make excuses or offer vague justifications for their behavior. For example, they could say they were under pressure or that someone else was responsible.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Unusual Communication Patterns:** Cheaters might exhibit unusual or erratic communication patterns, such as frequent cancellations or sudden unavailability.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Attempts to Control the Narrative:** They might try to control the conversation or dictate what information you should focus on to steer away from the truth.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Manipulative Behavior:** Cheaters often use manipulation to keep others from questioning their actions. This can include playing the victim or making others feel guilty.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Skepticism Towards Accusations:** They might express skepticism towards accusations and deny any wrongdoing, even when presented with strong evidence.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **Denial of Intentions:** Cheaters may deny having any intention to deceive, even though their actions suggest otherwise.\n",
