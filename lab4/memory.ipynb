Unicorn blood is highly cursed but can temporarily sustain life—even for someone clinging to it.\\n\\n3. **Encounter with Quirrell/Voldemort**: Harry came face-to-face with a cloaked figure (later revealed to be Quirrell possessed by Voldemort) drinking the unicorn’s blood to survive. The figure attacked Harry, causing his scar to burn agonizingly.\\n\\n4. **Intervention by Firenze**: The centaur Firenze rescued Harry, carrying him to safety. He explained the significance of the unicorn’s blood and hinted at Voldemort’s survival, telling Harry that \"the forest is not safe at this time\"—especially for those opposed to \"the thing that is drinking the unicorn’s blood.\"\\n\\nKey revelations from this scene:\\n- Confirmed Voldemort was still alive (via Quirrell’s possession).\\n- Established unicorn blood’s cursed nature and Voldemort’s desperation.\\n- Introduced centaurs (like Firenze) and their knowledge of wizarding affairs.\\n\\nNote: The provided excerpts in your request did not contain this scene, so this summary is based on the canonical events from *Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone*.
